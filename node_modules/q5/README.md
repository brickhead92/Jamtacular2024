[**q5.js**](https://q5js.org) is a spiritual successor to the [p5.js][] and [Processing Java][] graphics libraries.

The q5 team aims to make creative coding even more fun and accessible for a new generation of artists, designers, educators, and beginners!

If you're already familiar with p5, you'll find yourself right at home with q5. It's also compatible with popular addons, including [p5.sound][] and [p5play][].

## No Installation Required

Try out the [q5.js template sketch](https://aijs.io/editor?user=quinton-ashley&project=logoSpin) for the Aijs online code editor.

Use q5.js in your own project by adding this line to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://q5js.org/q5.js"></script>
```

q5 is also available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/q5)!

```bash
npm install q5
```

## Using p5 Addon Libraries

q5 is compatible with popular p5 addons and projects that use p5, such as [p5play][], because it aliases `Q5` to `p5`.

To use addons, simply load them after q5.js:

```html
<script src="https://q5js.org/q5.js"></script>
<!-- load p5 addons after q5 -->
<script src="https://p5play.org/v3/planck.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://p5play.org/v3/p5play.js"></script>
```

## Documentation

Browse the [q5 reference pages](https://q5js.org/learn) to learn how to use q5.js.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/q5js/q5.js/wiki) for extended documentation of q5's exclusive features.

Use the [q5.d.ts](q5.d.ts) file in Visual Studio Code to get autocompletion and inline hover-over documentation. Simply add this `jsconfig.json` file to your project folder:

```json
{
	"compilerOptions": {
		"target": "ESNext"
	},
	"include": ["*.js", "**/*.js", "node_modules/q5/q5.d.ts"]
}
```

## Modular Use

**p5.js** is nearly 5MB in size. This is mainly due to lengthy JSDoc comments, [the WebGL render, and the dependencies corejs and opentype](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/6776#issuecomment-1918238317). If 2d rendering is all a sketch needs, p5 wastes user bandwidth and is slower to load, parse, and run.

**q5.js** (the default bundle) is 98% smaller than p5, which is already great for typical use. For extremely lightweight use you can load a subset of scripts from the `src` folder.

See the [src/readme.md](src/readme.md) for more info on modular use.
